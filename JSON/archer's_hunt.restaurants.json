It has now grown into a full quick service restaurant operating with 4 branches. Growing up in a family with a restaurant background, most of their menu started at home in their small kitchen and has evolved to what it has now been known for – fried chicken, noodles, dimsum and milk teas. Despite the unfavorable support from their family and with limited startup capital, they pursued their passion and love for food, cooking and creative new ideas.",
